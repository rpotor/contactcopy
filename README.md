# contactcopy
An application to copy the alliance contact list from a character to the personal contact list of another character. This is an entry to the EVE Online API Challenge contest.

# Demo
A working demo of the application is located here: http://www.rpotor.com/EVE/contactcopy

# How does it work?
All information on how to use the application is provided on the website above, which I tried to make user-friendly, so I hope everything is clear, but I recommend reading the instructions attentively to avoid mix-ups. :-)

# Disclaimer
I'm light-years away from being a professional programmer, I just like to make up code to make my life easier. I have no formal education in php, javascript, html or anything like that, I just use self-improvement by Google :-) and I'm not afraid to RTFM the various documentations that are available on the net to make my code behave nicely. :-) Having said that, please use my application only if you're brave enough and not afraid if for example a black hole suddenly opens and devours the whole of planet Earth because I forgot a semicolon somewhere. If that happens, I do apologize in advance. :-)
